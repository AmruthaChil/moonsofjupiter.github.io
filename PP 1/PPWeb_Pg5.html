<li>It is 4247 times smaller than Earth. </li>
<li>Its orbit distance is 23,315,000 km.</li>
<li>It completes one orbit in about 730 Earth days.</li> 
<br>Numbers:
<li>It has an equatorial circumference of 9.4 km. </li>
<li>It has a surface area of 28.27 km<sup>2</sup>. </li>
<li>It has a surface gravity of 0.001 m/s<sup>2</sup>. </li>
<br>Name:
<li>It was originally named S/2001 J11. </li>
<li>Aitne is named after a Sicilian nymph who was raped by Jupiter when he was in the form of a vulture.  </li>
<li>This name is derived from the Greek for <i>I Burn</i>. It is commonly associated with Sicily’s volcano, Mount Etna.</li> 
<br>Habitable?
<li>This moon is irregularly shaped and also has a very small surface area and gravity. Thus, it is most likely not habitable.</li>
