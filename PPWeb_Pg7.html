<li>Its orbit distance is 23,969,000 km.</li>
<li>It completes one orbit in about 761 Earth days. </li>
<br>Numbers:
<li>It has an equatorial circumference of 12.6 km. </li>
<li>It has a surface area of 50.27 km<sup>2</sup>. </li>

<li>It is 3185 times smaller than Earth. </li>
<li>Its orbit distance is 24, 033,000 km.</li>
<li>It completes one orbit in 761 Earth days. </li>
<br>Numbers:
<li>It has an equatorial circumference of 12.6 km. </li>

<br>Name:
<li>It was originally S/2001 J1.</li>
<li>This moon is named after the mother of the Graces by Jupiter. </li>
<br>Habitable?
Like most other moons, this also has a very small surface area and gravity and is thus not habitable.   </li>

<li>This moon was originally thought of being an asteroid, but after a series of calculations about its orbit, it was published as a satellite of Jupiter.   </li>
<li>It is 1481 times smaller than Earth. </li>
<li>Its orbit distance is 24,102,000 km.</li>
<li>It completes one orbit in about 759 Earth days.</li>
